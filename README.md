# Web Bench 1.5

>   Registered on freshmeat.net as project web-bench.
>
>   Web Bench is very simple tool for benchmarking WWW or proxy servers. Uses `fork()` for simulating multiple clients and can use HTTP/0.9-HTTP/.1 requests.
>
>   This benchmark is not very realistic, but it can test if your HTTPD can realy handle that many clients at once (try to run some CGls) without taking your machine down. 
>
>   Displays *pages/min* and *bytes/sec*. Can be used in more aggressive mode with -f switch.
